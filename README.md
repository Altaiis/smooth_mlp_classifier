Smooth Decision Boundaries with Lipschitz Multi-Layer Perceptrons

Liu and al. (2022) (https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lip-mlp/) 
proposed a new architecture of Lipschitz Multi-Layer Perceptrons for shape interpolation and adversarial robustness. This paper
aims to demonstrate the efficiency of this type of network for classification. We show that the use of such an architecture yields smooth
results on simple binary classification tasks but it is not as efficient as spectral regularization.
